    "## Foreword\n",
    "\n",
    "Wew, there's actually so much I want to say here that I don't think I can say everything. I discovered this result around January 2024, and have been writing the paper on-and-off for more than half a year now, but never really found the inspiration to just properly sit down and finish it. The quick abstract of it is that you can solve the adversarial MIHNP with $1/n$ of the top bits of only $O(n)$ outputs, compared to $O(n^3)$ in the current state-of-the-art.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the original plans was to write a paper in time for SEETF, and then release the challenge along with the paper (so it's an implementation challenge). But then SEETF got scrapped. Some time later, I got dragged into SekaiCTF (I don't even remember how) and they said they were accepting zero-days, so here's the end result.\n",
    "\n",
    "I did not want to set the bounds \"too tight\" so to speak, especially for a 48-hour CTF. After some deliberation, I went with parameters that allowed me to solve the challenge with only 10 outputs and in under a minute. But I also gave 14 outputs, and infinite time (technically 48 hours) to allow solutions that were \"better than the state-of-the-art\" without having to be as tight as mine.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, my choice to give the highest $\\frac{1}{3}$ of bits was particularly significant because the current state-of-the-art was [this paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10089839) which explicitly stated that for the $\\frac{1}{3}$ case you needed 32 outputs (which we don't have) and a lattice of dimension 46441 (which is not practical), implying that their construction would not be sufficient. The intended solve path then would be to try to \"filter out\" bad polynomials from their lattice to improve its strength.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, multiple players managed to use the paper anyway to solve it directly, proving that crypto players are absolutely insane.\n",
    "- First blood was `bachpc` from `thehackerscrew`, who used 13 outputs and a 750x750 lattice (45 minutes?)\n",
    "- Second blood was `ks`, from `ks loves leoneed&mmj`, who used 11 outputs and a 914x914 lattice (1-2 hours maybe?)\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations to them, and anyone else who solved the challenge! While they didn't rediscover my construction, I found their approach insightful, both in terms of the strength of that paper's lattice construction, as well as in understanding crypto players' perserverance and determination in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The intended solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The brief explanation is that the lattices constructed in that paper contain lots of good polynomials, but also lots of bad ones. If we filter out all the bad ones, you end up with the SBG space. Be sure to have read the [hint on the SBG space](zerodaycrypto_hint.pdf) as a pre-requisite.\n",
    "\n",
    "What follows in the rest of the notebook is a demonstration of how to construct the good polynomials. The exposition is meant to be more practical than theoretical, so I'll omit or handwave away the proofs and defer that to the paper which I hope to finish writing sometime. But also if anyone else is reading and loves this kind of stuff (especially if you've solved the challenge), I am taking co-authors!\n",
    "\n",
    "### First, the problem statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "Simultaneously solve ten equations of the form\n",
    "$$(k + i)(x_i + A_i) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p},$$\n",
    "where $k \\in \\mathbb{F}$ is unknown, $x_i \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, 2^{170}-1\\}$ are small and unknown small, $A_i$ are known, and $i = 1,2,\\ldots,10$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, for `zerodaycrypto` we have the values $p = 2^{255}-19$ and "
